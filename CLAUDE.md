## What This Project Is

Rebuilding acustomcoach.com for A Custom Coach / Boulder Transportation — a Denver/Boulder luxury ground transportation company established September 1, 1988 by John Hafer (Bobby's uncle). The original website went down when the hosting provider (iVenue / Market America) permanently closed. No backups existed.

All site content was recovered from Google's cached index, Wayback Machine snapshots, and business directory listings (BBB, Yelp, Nextdoor, LimoHQ). The recovery document in `_context/site-recovery.md` is the content source of truth.

This project also serves as the proof-of-concept for Speed of Now Productions' SMB digital recovery service offering.

## Design System (LOCKED)

### Concept: "Old Money Meets Modern Convenience"

37 years of trust, distilled into a digital presence that feels like a first-class lounge. Dark, warm, confident. The kind of brand that doesn't need to shout.

### Colors

| Token | Hex | Tailwind Class | Usage |
|-------|-----|----------------|-------|
| foundation | `#0F0F0F` | `bg-foundation` | Page background |
| surface | `#1A1917` | `bg-surface` | Card/section backgrounds |
| elevated | `#242220` | `bg-elevated` | Elevated surfaces, hover states |
| gold | `#D4AF37` | `text-gold`, `bg-gold` | Primary accent, CTAs, labels |
| gold-light | `#E8C95A` | `text-gold-light` | Hover states, highlights |
| gold-muted | `rgba(212,175,55,0.22)` | `bg-gold-muted` | Subtle backgrounds |
| cream | `#F5F0E8` | `text-cream` | Primary text |
| cream-muted | `#CCC5B9` | `text-cream-muted` | Secondary text |
| white | `#FAFAF8` | `text-white` | Headlines, emphasis |
| border-gold | `rgba(212,175,55,0.35)` | `border-border-gold` | Accent borders |
| border-subtle | `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` | `border-border-subtle` | Structural dividers |

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weights |
|------|------|---------|
| Headlines | Playfair Display (serif) | 400, 500, 600, 700 |
| Body | DM Sans (sans-serif) | 300, 400, 500, 600 |

Loaded via Google Fonts `<link>` tags in `layout.tsx` (not `next/font` — build environment can't fetch at compile time).

### Type Scale

| Level | Size | Font | Usage |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| H1 | 48px | Playfair Display 500 | Page heroes |
| H2 | 32px | Playfair Display 500 | Section headings |
| H3 | 24px | Playfair Display 500 | Card/subsection headings |
| Body Large | 18px | DM Sans 500 | Subheadings, lead text |
| Body | 15px | DM Sans 400 | Paragraph text |
| Small | 13px | DM Sans 400 | Secondary info, captions |
| Label | 10px | DM Sans 500, uppercase, 0.2em tracking | Section labels, tags |

### Component Patterns

- **Primary button:** Gold gradient (`from-gold to-[#B8962E]`), dark text, uppercase, 0.08em tracking, 6px radius
- **Secondary button:** Transparent, gold border, cream text, uppercase
- **Text link button:** Gold text, underline on hover
- **Cards:** `surface` or `elevated` bg, `border-subtle` or `border-gold` border, 10-12px radius
- **Section labels:** 10px gold, uppercase, 0.2em letter-spacing, above headings
- **Trust indicators:** Large Playfair numbers in gold, small uppercase DM Sans labels

### Design Principles

- **Photography:** Dark overlays on recovered images until new photos arrive. No generic stock. Subtle grain on placeholders.
- **Animation:** Restrained. Fade-ups on scroll, smooth hover states. Nothing bouncy — this is a black-car service, not a party bus.
- **Mobile:** Sticky CTA bar with Call and Book buttons. Phone number always one tap away. Hamburger nav with full-screen overlay.
- **Spacing:** Generous. Let the dark background breathe. Premium = room to think.

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-based `@theme {}` config in globals.css — no tailwind.config.js) |
| Fonts | Google Fonts via `<link>` in layout.tsx |
| Deployment | Vercel (planned) |
| Repo | GitHub — `acustomcoach` |

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── globals.css           ← Tailwind v4 @theme with all design tokens
│   ├── layout.tsx            ← Root layout, fonts, SEO metadata

└── styles/                   ← (empty — globals.css handles everything)
```

### Tailwind v4 Notes
- Theme defined via `@theme {}` block in `globals.css`, NOT a JS config file
- Custom colors: `--color-foundation`, `--color-gold`, etc. → used as `text-gold`, `bg-surface`
- Custom fonts: `--font-display`, `--font-body`

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **No landing page phase.** The old site (copyright 2013, no responsive, no SEO) was doing nothing for the business. John's pipeline is referrals and repeat clients. Go straight to full build.
2. **Build first, verify later.** Use recovered data as-is. Phone numbers, addresses, hours are easy swaps. Don't wait on a 60-year-old finding his GoDaddy password.
3. **FASTTRAK = link, don't rebuild.** FASTTRAK Cloud handles booking, dispatch, billing. If portal URL exists → link to it. If not → simple inquiry form that emails the office. Don't rebuild what FASTTRAK already does.
4. **Dark premium aesthetic.** Approved via style tile. Not negotiable without Bobby's sign-off.
5. **Portfolio piece.** This doubles as a Speed of Now Productions case study. Craft matters.
6. **Tiered pricing established.** Family rate: $1,500 site + $350 email + $450 SEO = $2,300 total. Market equivalent: $7,700–$16,100. See `_context/service-scope-pricing.md`.

## Open Questions (Waiting on Client)

All tracked in detail in `_context/client-answers.md`. Summary:

- **Domain ownership** — registrar, credentials, email on account (CRITICAL for go-live)
- **Address** — Missouri Ave (BBB) vs Commerce City (Yelp)
- **Fleet** — current vehicles vs old site listing
- **FASTTRAK portal URL** — needed for booking integration
- **Hours** — Nextdoor data unconfirmed
- **Bobby Long as GM** — display on new site?
- **Photos** — none recovered, need from John or plan shoot
- **Google Business Profile** — active? access?
- **Email** — current setup, mailbox count needed

---

## File Conventions

| Folder | Purpose | Rules |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `_context/` | Reference material | Read only. Don't modify unless Bobby says to. |
| `_business/` | Speed of Now planning | Case study, playbook, prospect list. Builds over time. |
| `deliverables/` | Client-facing output | Write for a 60-year-old business owner. No jargon. |
| `site/` | The codebase | Proper git workflow. Feature branches, clean commits. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file | Update when milestones complete. |

---

## Rules

- **Don't invent content.** Use `_context/site-recovery.md` as starting point. Tighten and modernize, but don't fabricate services, claims, or details.
- **Flag conflicts.** If sources disagree, note the discrepancy — don't silently pick one.
- **TODO comments in code.** Any unverified business detail should have `// TODO: Verify with client`.
- **Write deliverables for the audience.** John is 60+. Mom is the go-between. No tech jargon in client-facing docs.
- **Don't pad timelines.** Bobby moves fast. Three full-stack apps in three days fast.
- **Git discipline.** Feature branches, meaningful commit messages.
- **Update this file** when major milestones complete.
